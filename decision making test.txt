Q.2.
XYZ Technologies is in the process of increment the salary of the employees. This
increment is done based on their salary and their performance appraisal rating.
If the appraisal rating is between 1 and 3, the increment is 10% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 3.1 and 4, the increment is 25% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 4.1 and 5, the increment is 30% of the salary.
Help them to do this, by writing a program that displays the incremented salary. Write a
class “IncrementCalculation.java” and write the main method in it.
Note : If either the salary is 0 or negative (or) if the appraisal rating is not in the range 1 to
5 (inclusive), then the output should be “Invalid Input”.

Q.4.
An intelligence agency has received reports about some threats. The reports consist of
numbers in a mysterious method. There is a number “N” and another number “R”. Those
numbers are studied thoroughly and it is concluded that all digits of the number ‘N’ are
summed up and this action is performed ‘R’ number of times. The resultant is also a single
digit that is yet to be deciphered. The task here is to find the single-digit sum of the given
number ‘N’ by repeating the action ‘R’ number of times.
If the value of ‘R’ is 0, print the output as ‘0’.
Example 1:
Input :
99 -> Value of N
3 -> Value of R
Output :
9 -> Possible ways to fill the cistern.
Explanation:
Here, the number N=99
1)Sum of the digits N: 9+9 = 18
2)Repeat step 2 ‘R’ times i.e. 3 tims (9+9)+(9+9)+(9+9) = 18+18+18 =54
3)Add digits of 54 as we need a single digit 5+4
Hence , the output is 9.
Example 2:
Input :
1234 -> Value of N
2 -> Value of R
Output :
2 -> Possible ways to fill the cistern
Explanation:
Here, the number N=1234
1)Sum of the digits of N: 1+2+3+4 =10
2)Repeat step 2 ‘R’ times i.e. 2 times (1+2+3+4)+(1+2+3+4)= 10+10=20
3)Add digits of 20 as we need a single digit. 2+0=2
Hence, the output is 2.
Constraints:
0<N<=1000
0<=R<=50
The Input format for testing
The candidate has to write the code to accept 2 input(s)
First input- Accept value for N (positive integer number)
Second input: Accept value for R(Positive integer number)
The output format for testing
The output should be a positive integer number or print the message (if any) given in the
problem statement. (Check the output in Example 1, Example 2).

Q.5.
There is a JAR full of candies for sale at a mall counter. JAR has the capacity N, that is JAR
can contain maximum N candies when JAR is full. At any point of time. JAR can have M
number of Candies where M<=N. Candies are served to the customers. JAR is never remain
empty as when last k candies are left. JAR if refilled with new candies in such a way that
JAR get full.
Write a code to implement above scenario. Display JAR at counter with available number of
candies. Input should be the number of candies one customer can order at point of time.
Update the JAR after each purchase and display JAR at Counter.
Output should give number of Candies sold and updated number of Candies in JAR.
If Input is more than candies in JAR, return: “INVALID INPUT”
Given,
N=10, where N is NUMBER OF CANDIES AVAILABLE
K =< 5, where k is number of minimum candies that must be inside JAR ever.
Example 1:(N = 10, k =< 5)
